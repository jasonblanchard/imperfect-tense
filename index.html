						<h1>Imperfect Tense</h1>
					
						<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
						<p>Is it possible for two people to fall in love in the wrong direction?</p>
						<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
						<p>Shortly before Christopher died, I met him for the second time. It was the first day of the fall semester for the Tuesday-Thursday section of my Intro to Quantum Physiology <sup>i</sup> course <sup>1</sup>, Room 3-270 in Building 3 at MIT. I had been spending my nights sleeping in the hard plastic chairs at the VNA Care Network & Hospice out near Harvard Square <sup>ii</sup>, waiting and watching as the man I loved succumbed to a tumor I had caused[see 10], and I was so utterly exhausted by the time the semester had started that it had never occurred to me that this would be the Fall when it first started. If I had tenure, maybe I would have taken a sabbatical, but unfortunately an Associate Professor is not afforded such luxuries[see 15]. I hadn't even had time to look at the class roster yet — of course, it being a lecture with one-hundred nineteen students, there were far too many names for me to recognize anyway, and some of them would certainly drop the course over the next two weeks.
						</p>
						<p>
							But as I stood there in front of the class, fighting sleep and struggling to explain the syllabus to a sea of disinterested students, I noticed him there in the corner of my eye, sitting in the third row of the classroom. He looked so young and able-bodied, more like the boy that I'd first met than the sickly, dying man I'd come to love. I watched him yawn and stretch his slender arms up towards the sky, still as pale and toned as I remembered them. He pulled that same old, unwashed Red Sox hatiii back onto his forehead as he shifted his posture in the cramped fixed-tablet armchair, revealing a mismatched pair of penetrating eyes — one greyish-green, the other browniv. I had never seen his eyes like that before, and although I could barely make them out from where I stood, the difference was bright enough to see, if one was looking for it. I was immediately struck by the beautiful earthiness of such a distinct imperfection, and I understood then why he was so distraught at losing them <sup>2</sup>. It wasn't until that moment when I saw into those mismatched eyes that I finally started piecing it together. And there he sat in front of me again, younger than I'd ever known him to be and fully unaware of the life that we had had, and were having, and were going to have, together. A life that I'd experienced and was experiencing. A life that I was on the brink of losing once again, as I would be forced to mourn the loss of the same man twice[see 3].
						</p>
						<p>
							I fumbled through the rest of the syllabus, trying to keep my mind off the fact that I had just locked my own fate into place. Rather than jump right into teaching — and make an even worse impression on the students as the awkward, unprepared academic that I was — I let the class leave early. Chris was part of the group that ran out of the room before I had the chance to change my mind. I was relieved to see him go, as I was not prepared to interact with him, not yet. But still, I was overcome with pangs of sadness as I watched him walk away from me so swiftly, as if I were a perfect stranger. I supposed, to him, I was.
						</p>
						<p>
						   My Christopher had told me years ago that this was how it started, though he never could remember precisely when it happened. We were never sure if it was the brain tumor that had damaged his memory, or if there was some other temporal anomaly to blame. But I had been so focused on his death that I forgot about the life that he had yet to live.

This lecture-style course focuses on the quantum-level behaviors that lead to certain atomic functions of living organisms, offering a unique interdisciplinary perspective on neuroscience, biology, and physics."

			   					Christopher John Fabula was born in Danvers, Massachusetts, approximately thirty miles outside of Boston, on 27 October 2004 — the same day that the Boston Red Sox won their first World Series in 86 years, breaking their so-called "Curse of the Bambino." As such, Chris felt a strong spiritual connection to the team. The hat in question had a green brim and siding, with a white front bearing the iconic trademarked "B" of the team, and which he had originally procured in the summer before his senior year of high school in 2022 after losing his fully dark-blue Red Sox hat on a whitewater-rafting trip in Maine.

						<li><p>Most of my students don't realize that "Quantum Physiology" is actually a pun. They either assume it's a typo, or that's it's just some fancy academic-sounding class with no prerequisites that fulfills a science requirement and isn't full of obnoxiously overeager freshmen. The former group is wrong, anyway. In this particular instance, "quantum" is an adjective, meaning "sudden" or "significant," which then modifies "physiology," being the study of organic processes or functions of an organism or organisms. But of course, at the same time "quantum" typically refers to physics, being the fundamental unit of quantized physical magnitude in terms of angular momentum, and also the smallest quantity of radiant energy. And so the class is actually focused on the study of significant and / or sudden organic processes, as viewed specifically through the lens of quantum mechanics. For example, there's a part of the curriculum dedicated to cancer. Not dedicated like, "in honor of" — although I guess that, too — but like an academic concentration on cancer, and the mechanical physics and unbalanced chemical equations that can cause a tumor to form. It's not about the physical tumor, so much as it is about the quantum-level behaviors that lead to a certain atomic malfunction which in turn causes to replicate some small but crucial piece of cellular information which then continues to replicate itself ad infinitum until it causes permanent and ultimately critical damage to the physical body of which it is a larger part.</p>
						<p>Basically, it's the study of the organism as a machine, how math and physics relate to and affect the typical functions of a living thing. So, it's a pun. Get it?</p>

								It wasn't until I brought him back to my apartment the morning after we first met[see "Materials & Methods," below] that we realized that something had gone wrong. We were about to take a shower when Chris caught his reflection in the mirror and turned back to examine his newly reconstructed form.
							</p>
							<p>
								"Wait — did you see my eyes? What color are they?" he said, suddenly sounding nervous.
							</p>
							<p>
								"Brown," I said, and went back to adjusting the water temperature, which involved a Rube Goldberg-esque contraption of rusted antique shower knobs and a great deal of concentration. With my back to him, I added, "Are you trying to test my attention to detail? What kind of question is that?"
							</p>
							<p>
								"Two brown eyes. You travel back in time and all you have to show for it is another pair of shit-brown eyes." He would describe them that way until the day he died. "They're supposed to be off. My left one, it's always been this weird shade of greyish-green. That was like, the only thing I ever had he's not — so anyway the girls always thought my eyes, they said it was a kind of sexy quirk, I guess. Point is, now they're both just plain oldshit-brown eyes."
							</p>
							<p>
								I stood up and went to comfort him, tracing my hands along his lithe upper arms. "Maybe it's just the light," I said. "Or maybe your body is still adjusting. Keep in mind that you just underwent an extreme quantum physical trauma. Besides, you shouldn't have to worry what the other girls like."
							</p>
							<p>
							   Looking back, I should have been more concerned, more sensitive to his situation, having freshly emerged from the Nonlinear Molecular Teleportation Matrix. But instead I kissed him and pulled him with me into the hot running water. Only later would we realize that his ocular normalization was indicative of a much larger problem[see 10].
